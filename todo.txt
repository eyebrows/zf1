 - core dev
	- resolve the issue with User "default fields" being in Mapper and "operations on fields" (e.g. encrypt password) being in Model
	   - seems that the Mapper should be the one hashing the password if a new one's set...
    - see if the form validation stuff from AuthController::registerAction can go in the form itself somehow
	+ ensure login and logout works, with different links at the top
       - admin users having access to modify settings
	   - customer being able to see library
	   - and search it
	- use ACLs (probably) to do the user types thing with different pages to admin/authed/non-authed visitors
	- where can "auth state loader" go so that state doesn't have to be loaded in every single Action of every Controller?
	  needed because atm if you go to a Controller/Action without it, you get the un-authed nav appearing
	   + can get it per-controller by placing in the Controller::init() method... can we get it application-wide?
	      - now look to move out the code in to the Plugin_Authenticate thing
 - a test case for the Mapper::save() with referenced objects would be
	- make sure save() knows about ORM_Placeholder
    - pull a Book from the db but don't do getReferenced('Authors')
    - pull an Author from the db
    - set the Book's Author to the new one and save() it and see if it works
	- also try it after getReferenced('Authors') had been called
 - post-core nice to haves
    - find out how the fuck Bootstrap class operates such that moving _initDoctype below _initViewHelpers fucks it all up :/
	+ would be nice to have ReferencedPlaceholder & DependentPlaceholder as actual objects, but where do they go in the filesystem?
	   + but first need Abstract stuff moving into an orm heirarchy
    + see if Mapper_Abstract's new getDbTable method can tidy any of the getReferenced/getDependent stuff
    + consider scrapping Model_Abstract's __call shortcut as getReferenced() is a bit more sensibly named
    - consider making a Model for "list of books" so we can pull a join instead of multiple pulls for authors/category/etc
	- do something about the default usertype_id being hardcoded in User's Mapper
